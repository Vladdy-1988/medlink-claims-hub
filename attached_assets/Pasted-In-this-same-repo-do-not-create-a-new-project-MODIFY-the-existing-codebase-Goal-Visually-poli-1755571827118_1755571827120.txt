In this same repo, do not create a new project; MODIFY the existing codebase.

Goal: Visually polish MedLink Claims Hub using Tailwind + Radix UI primitives so it looks clean, modern, and medical-grade. Keep all functionality, routes, APIs, tests, and PWA behavior intact.

Constraints:
- NO breaking changes to auth, APIs, data, or service worker.
- Keep all pages and flows; this is a styling/UX pass.
- Use Tailwind + Radix primitives + lucide-react icons (if not installed, add).
- Maintain accessibility (labels, aria-*, focus states, contrast).

1) Design tokens & theming
- Tailwind: add a small design system in tailwind.config:
  - fontFamily: Inter, system sans
  - radius: xl: "1rem", "2xl": "1.25rem"
  - shadows: soft cards
  - colors: create aliases for brand using Tailwind’s teal/sky/slate:
    primary = teal (500/600/700), secondary = sky, muted = slate
- Global CSS: define CSS variables for light/dark themes:
  :root { --bg: 255 255 255; --fg: 15 23 42; --card: 248 250 252; --brand: 20 184 166; }
  .dark { --bg: 2 6 23; --fg: 226 232 240; --card: 15 23 42; }
  Use these via Tailwind’s arbitrary colors (e.g., bg-[rgb(var(--bg))]).
- index.html: add Inter via Google Fonts (display=swap) and set <meta name="theme-color"> to brand color for PWA.

2) App shell & navigation
- Create reusable <AppShell> with:
  - Topbar: logo “MedLink Claims” (lucide Stethoscope), global search, dark-mode toggle, user menu.
  - Sidebar: icons + labels for Dashboard, Claims, Pre-Auths, Remittances, Settings, Admin (if role=admin).
  - Responsive: collapsible sidebar on mobile.
- Persist dark/light preference in localStorage and respect prefers-color-scheme.

3) Reusable UI components (in /apps/web/src/components)
- <Card>, <Button>, <Input>, <Select>, <Label>, <Badge>, <Tabs>, <Table>, <Modal>, <Toast>, <Skeleton>, <EmptyState>, <Stepper>, <Timeline>
- Style: rounded-2xl, soft shadows, subtle borders, generous spacing (p-6), hover/active states, focus-visible rings.
- Status badges: draft (slate), submitted (sky), pending (amber), infoRequested (violet), paid (emerald), denied (rose).
- FileUpload: nicer dropzone (dashed border + icon + helper text).

4) Page polish
- Dashboard (/): 2-col responsive grid: KPI cards (Draft / Submitted / Pending / Paid / Denied) with small trend sparkline; “New Pre-Auth” and “New Claim” primary buttons.
- Claims (/claims): 
  - Sticky table header, zebra rows, column sorting, filter chips (status, payer) above table, search input.
  - Empty state: icon + CTA to create first claim.
- New Claim (/claims/new): 3-step wizard with <Stepper> (Patient → Services/Codes → Attachments & Submit).
  - Autosave indicator (“Saved • 3s ago”) and subtle progress bar.
  - Primary “Submit” button, secondary “Save draft”.
- Claim Detail (/claims/:id): 
  - Header card with claim id, patient, payer, amount, status badge + actions (Download PDF, Add Note).
  - <Timeline> right rail (Created → Submitted → Pending → Info Requested → Paid/Denied) with icons.
  - Attachments card with previews and file meta; drag-to-upload zone.
- Pre-Auths (/preauths/new): same polish as claim wizard (shorter form).
- Remittances (/remittances): cards list; detail view shows parsed fields and a “Raw JSON” toggle.
- OfflineBanner: convert to a slim top bar with cloud-slash icon + clear message.

5) Accessibility & micro-interactions
- Ensure all interactive elements have focus-visible rings (ring-brand/40).
- Add subtle transitions (transition-all duration-150) and reduced-motion safe guards.
- Tooltip help icons (Radix Tooltip) for tricky fields (procedure codes, rails).
- Keep contrast AA+ in both themes.

6) Icons & visuals
- Use lucide-react icons: LayoutDashboard, FileText, ScanLine, FileCheck2, Settings, ShieldCheck, Moon, Sun, CloudOff, BadgeCheck, XCircle.
- Replace plain text status with badge + icon.

7) Tests & PWA
- Update tests/selectors if class names changed; keep semantics stable (data-testid where needed).
- Do NOT change service worker scope or manifest except theme-color and icons if required.

8) Acceptance criteria
- Visual polish applied to all pages above.
- Dark mode toggle works and persists.
- Table has sticky header, filters, and good spacing.
- Wizards show stepper + autosave indicator.
- Timeline renders with icons and correct statuses.
- No changes to business logic; all existing flows continue to pass.
- Lighthouse (desktop) performance ≥ 90, accessibility ≥ 95, best practices ≥ 95.

Deliverables:
- Updated Tailwind config, global CSS, AppShell, components, and refactored pages.
- Minimal README note: “UI polish pass + how to change brand colors.”
