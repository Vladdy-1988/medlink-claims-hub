Act as a senior engineer. Produce a PROOF PACK that demonstrates the features you said you implemented. Do not summarize; SHOW FILES, DIFFS, COMMANDS, and OUTPUT. Create/append to `docs/PROOF_PACK.md` with sections:

A) FIELD-LEVEL ENCRYPTION (AES-256-GCM)
- List file paths you added/modified (encryption util, model/hooks, middleware).
- Show the exact encrypt/decrypt code (redact keys), confirm unique IV per record and authenticated tag handling; note AAD if used.
- Show where the key comes from (ENV/KMS) and the env var names. Prove keys are NOT in repo.
- If you store key id (KID) metadata, show where.

B) DB EVIDENCE (NO plaintext)
- Create a test record with a PHI string marker: `ZZZTESTSECRET_123`.
- Show the raw DB row via SQL (not app) proving the column is ciphertext (no readable `ZZZTESTSECRET_123`).
- Show the app successfully decrypting that same record.

C) MFA FOR ADMINS
- List changed files (routes/controllers/views).
- Show the data model for TOTP secret storage (hashed/encrypted), backup codes (hashed), and rate-limit config.
- Run an end-to-end admin login in a local test and show the server logs (scrub secrets) demonstrating the second factor is required.

D) EDI SANDBOX / BLOCK REAL ENDPOINTS
- Show the env toggle: `EDI_MODE=sandbox`.
- Show the outbound allowlist/denylist code. Include one test call to a REAL insurer domain and prove it’s blocked with a SANDBOX error.
- Show the mock endpoints and an example SANDBOX response (prefix `SANDBOX-`).

E) DATA ANONYMIZATION PIPELINE
- List files (generator, mappers).
- Show the mapping table: source PHI field → anonymized synthetic.
- Run the generator and show 3 example anonymized records.

F) LOAD TESTS (k6)
- Show the scripts in `tests/load/`. Run `k6` (smoke) against local and paste the p95 latency & error rate.
- Save the results JSON to `tests/load/results/last_run.json`.

G) AUDIT LOGGING
- Show where PHI-touching routes emit structured audit events (no PHI content). Paste one sample JSON line.
- Run the CSV export script and paste the first 5 lines.

H) BACKUPS/RESTORE DRILL (STAGING)
- Show the GitHub Actions workflow files for nightly backup and manual restore test.
- Trigger the restore test (workflow_dispatch) and paste the log excerpt proving a fresh DB was restored and a smoke query passed.

I) MONITORING
- Show Sentry init in backend and frontend guarded by env. Trigger a test error and paste the “event id” printed to logs.
- Show `/healthz` output and `scripts/uptime.sh` exit codes.

At the end of PROOF_PACK.md, add a checklist mapping each claim to a file/command/output link within the repo.
