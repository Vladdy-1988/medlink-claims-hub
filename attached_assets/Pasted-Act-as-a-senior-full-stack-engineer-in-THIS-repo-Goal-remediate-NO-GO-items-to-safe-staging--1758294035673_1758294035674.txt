Act as a senior full-stack engineer in THIS repo. Goal: remediate “NO-GO” items to safe **staging** readiness (not production). Create branch `remediation/launch-readiness`, work there, and open a draft PR to `main`. Don’t claim legal compliance—document gaps. When done, produce a FINAL_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md mapping fixes to files/commits.

1) Fix CSS MIME / static assets
- Ensure Vite builds to `dist/` with `/assets/*.css`.
- Express server: serve static BEFORE any API catch-all.
  Example:
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,'dist')));
    app.get('/healthz', (_req,res)=>res.status(200).send('ok'));
    app.get('*', (_req,res)=>res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname,'dist','index.html')));
- Verify `/assets/*.css` returns `Content-Type: text/css`.
- Add docs/troubleshooting/css-mime.md with what changed.

2) Security headers baseline
- Add Helmet with CSP off for now, set HSTS, referrerPolicy, secure/httponly/samesite cookies.
- Document in docs/security/headers.md.

3) Monitoring & health
- Integrate Sentry (backend: @sentry/node; frontend: @sentry/react) gated by env vars.
  ENV: SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_ENV=remediation, RELEASE_SHA (commit).
- Ensure /healthz returns 200 OK.
- Add scripts/uptime.sh that curls /healthz and exits non-zero on failure.
- Document wiring to any uptime service.

4) Secrets audit
- Remove any hard-coded secrets. Read from process.env.
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders for DATABASE_URL, SENTRY_DSN, NODE_ENV, etc.
- docs/security/secrets.md: rotation and least-privilege policy.

5) Backups & DR (STAGING ONLY now)
- Add scripts/backup/pg_dump.sh to dump from $STAGING_DATABASE_URL.
- Nightly GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/staging-db-backup.yml` uploads to S3 with server-side encryption (no dumps in repo/artifacts).
- Add manual restore test workflow `.github/workflows/staging-restore-test.yml` that restores to a temp DB and runs a smoke query.
- docs/runbooks/dr.md: step-by-step restore; targets RPO≤24h, RTO≤4h.
- Create PROD scripts but comment: “do not enable until compliance gate.”

6) RBAC hardening
- Roles: patient, provider, staff, admin.
- Middleware route guards; admin-only routes fenced.
- Add tests for permitted/denied access.

7) Audit logging (no PHI content)
- On PHI-touching endpoints, log structured events: ts, userId, role, action, resourceId, purpose.
- Daily rotation; scripts/audit/export-audit-report.ts for CSV by date range.
- docs/security/audit-logging.md with retention.

8) CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: node setup, npm ci, lint, typecheck, tests (vitest/jest).
- Add GitHub CodeQL for JS/TS. Fail PRs on errors.
- Update README with CI status.

9) Minimal load test
- Add k6 scripts: load/smoke.js and load/peak.js that hit auth (if any), list claims, claim detail.
- `.github/workflows/k6.yml` manual run (workflow_dispatch) with BASE_URL input. Print p95 latency + error rate.
- docs/perf/budget.md with initial targets (e.g., p95 < 400ms on /api/claims under N users).

10) i18n
- Wire i18next (or react-intl). Extract UI strings to `locales/en.json`.
- Add `locales/fr.json` with 5 example keys translated.
- docs/i18n.md: how to add/translate strings.

11) PWA
- Add `manifest.webmanifest`, link in index.html.
- Generate icons (192, 512, maskable). Use vite-plugin-pwa with injectManifest and offline shell fallback.
- docs/pwa.md; verify installable in Lighthouse.

12) Final checklist
- Create FINAL_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md mapping each NO-GO area to commits/files (backups, monitoring, headers, secrets, RBAC, audit, CI, load tests, i18n, PWA, docs). List remaining gaps with Owner=Vlad and target dates.

ACCEPTANCE (verify before finishing):
- No CSS MIME errors; styles load; `/assets/*.css` is `text/css`.
- Security headers present (HSTS, Helmet). Cookies secure/httponly/samesite where used.
- Sentry sends events when DSN set; `/healthz` OK; uptime script works.
- `.env.example` present; no secrets in code.
- Staging backup workflow succeeds; restore test creates temp DB and runs a query; no dumps in repo or artifacts.
- RBAC tests pass; protected routes reject improper roles.
- Audit logs emitted on PHI endpoints; CSV export works.
- CI blocks failing PRs; CodeQL workflow active.
- k6 scripts run locally and via workflow_dispatch; p95 + error rate output.
- i18n toggles EN↔FR for sample labels.
- App is PWA-installable; icons valid.
